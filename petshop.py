#A pet shop sells two types of pets: cats and dogs. All pets have a size (small, medium, large). Cats always make a ‚ÄúMeow‚Äù noise. Dogs always make a ‚ÄúWoof‚Äù noise. 
# White cats are lazy and black cats are hunters. Brown dogs are guards and golden dogs are guides.
#  üëâ Model this in a class hierarchy: Base class: Pet Intermediate classes: Cat and Dog Lowest-level classes: Lazy, Hunter, Guard, and Guide. Each pet should be able to tell its type, color, job, size, and noise.
#  Finally: Instantiate a white cat (small) and a golden dog (large).

#(Quite literally the toy manufacturer but worded differently)
